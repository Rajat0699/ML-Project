ML-Project is a focused credit-risk modeling project that illustrates the full workflow from raw data to evaluated models. The repository includes the Credit Risk Benchmark Dataset, an interactive Jupyter notebook that performs data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, plus a Python script (main.py) for reproducible runs. The project is intended as a compact, reproducible example of credit scoring using standard machine-learning tooling. Key highlights:

- Dataset: Credit Risk Benchmark Dataset (CSV) — raw data used for analysis.
- Notebooks & scripts: Credit_risk.ipynb for analysis and visualization; main.py for scripted runs.
- Workflow: data ingestion → cleaning → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation.
- Purpose: to evaluate model performance on credit-risk prediction and provide a template for further experimentation and deployment.
